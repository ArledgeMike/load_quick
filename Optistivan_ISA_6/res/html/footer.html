          <h3>WARNING:IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS</h3>
          <p>OPTISTAVIN OPTISTAVIN (naxumab) can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions due to T-cell activation and proliferation. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of OPTISTAVIN.</p>
          <p>Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs) and thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose.</p>
          <p>Permanently discontinue OPTISTAVIN and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.</p>.

        <h3>Immune-mediated Enterocolitis:</h3>
        <ul>
         <li><p>I n the pivotal Phase 3 study in OPTISTAVIN-treated patients, severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of â‰¥7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3-5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 (7%) and moderate (diarrhea with up to 6 stools above baseline, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool; Grade 2) enterocolitis occurred in 28 (5%) patients</p></li>
         <li><p>Across all OPTISTAVIN-treated patients (n=511), 5 (1%) developed intestinal perforation, 4 (0.8%) died as a result of complications, and 26 (5%) were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis</p></li>
